# Road Map #

## 0.1 ##

  * Separate directories for test/src code
  * Cabal based build and install
  * Ability to run all programs from the GCL shootout

## Future ##

I am currently unsure of the future for HST. It was started as a project for myself to write a non trivial Haskell program. After I have achieved that, I'm not sure where it will go.

Some ideas of where it could go:
  * A fast Haskell interpreter, allowing Smalltalk programs to be written and run in a manner similar to Python/Ruby
  * An experiment in optimizing Haskell by attempting to achieve good shootout scores against other Smalltalk implementations
  * A DSL that allows dynamic OOP in Haskell (Similar to O'Haskell or OOHaskell)
  * A library that provides an easy/natural method of binding to OOP languages, such as C++, Python, Ruby
